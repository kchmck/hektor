.SH "NAME"
\fBHektor\fR \-\- Hughesnet 'fair access policy' usage calculator
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBhektor\fR [\fICOMMAND\fR=remaining] [\fIARGS\fR]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBHektor\fR calculates 'fair access policy' usage based on periodically recorded
usage 'snapshots.' Each snapshot contains usage numbers extracted from the modem
and the time it was recorded. Using a list of these snapshots, \fBhektor\fR can
calculate a rolling usage calculation based on the amount of data transferred
and refilled between each.
.
.SH "COMMANDS"
Partial command names are accepted for convenience; each command below shows its
shortest accepted form as the text (or single letter) before the bar (|). In
other words, '\fBhektor s\fR' and '\fBhektor st\fR' are equivalent to '\fBhektor stats\fR'.
.
.TP
\fBrem|aining\fR
Show the amount of megabytes remaining before the FAP is activated.
.
.TP
\fBrec|ord\fR
Record a new snapshot.
.
.TP
\fBd|rop\fR [\fIAMOUNT\fR=1]
Remove a certain AMOUNT of newly\-recorded snapshots.
.
.TP
\fBs|tats\fR
Display snapshot statistics.
.
.TP
\fBl|ist\fR
Display a detailed listing of snapshots.
.
.SH "SNAPSHOTS"
For greatest accuracy, snapshots should be recorded no more than ten minutes
apart. A \fBcron daemon\fR can be used to automate that task, since its purpose is
to do such periodic work. With \fBfcron\fR, an entry like the following will record
a new snapshot every five minutes (or 300 seconds):
.
.P
  @ 300s hektor record
.
.SH "TYPICAL USAGE"
Periodically check the remaining usage:
.
.P
  $ hektor
  170.01 megabytes are remaining.
.
.P
and periodically record new snapshots:
.
.P
  $ hektor rec
  Snapshot #145 was recorded.
  190.42 megabytes are remaining.
